# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
By collaborating  Airgead Banking, one of Chada Techâ€™s clients. develop a program that will teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive system.

# What did you do particularly well?
The pseudocode was my map toward the project since i had to plan the entire program on it so it will help he write the program. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Encapsulate data and provide accessors for exemple Instead of having all the member variables as public, encapsulate them by making them private and provide public accessors (getters and setters) to modify or retrieve their values. This helps maintain data integrity and allows for better control over the variables.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Designing the program structure: Determining the appropriate class structure, member variables, and functions to encapsulate the required functionality can be a challenge. Overcoming this challenge involves carefully analyzing the problem statement, identifying the core components, and organizing them into a logical structure.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Object-oriented programming (OOP): This project demonstrates the use of OOP principles by defining a class (InvestmentCalculator) and encapsulating related data and behaviors within it. Understanding and applying OOP concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and inheritance can be valuable in various programming projects

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Code organization and structure: The program is organized into a class (InvestmentCalculator), which encapsulates related data and functions. This helps in organizing code logically and improving maintainability by grouping related code together. Consider following a consistent naming convention and code organization style throughout the program.
